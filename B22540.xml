            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The English Manufacture Discouraged, His Majesties Customs Lessened, <hi>The Glass-Makers Ruined,</hi> And many Thousands of Poor Families Depending upon them, by reason of the Duties on Glass-Wares.</head>
            <p>1<hi>st,</hi> INasmuch as making Glass consumes very great quantities of Clay, Sand, Ashes, Kelp, Maggenees, Coals Wood, and Red and White Lead, all the Produce of our own Country, (and Imploys some Thousands in Collecting and gathering the same together) most of which are of a very small value to this Nation, until Manufactured into Glass; after which many Hundreds of poor Families keep themselves from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, by picking up broken Glass of all sorts to sell to the Maker.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> In making Glass is Expended great quantities of <hi>Borillo, Pulvereen, Salt-Petre, Pot-ashes</hi> small, &amp;c. which are Imported, and pay considerable Custom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Observe,</hi> If making Glassâ–ªManufactures so many Commodities of our own, and so many from Foreign Parts, Glass-making must be a very useful thing to this Nation, and therefore ought to be Encouraged, and not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, by oppressing it with a heavy Duty, just as the Art of making thereof, by length of time, great pains, and expence is brought to such Perfectionâ–ª to out-do all the World, which is manifest, inasmuch as we send Glass to those Parts, from whence we had the most and best we used.</p>
            <p>And that we are arrived to such Perfection, and are the Artists of the World, Foreign Parts are very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and have been very desirous of our Artists, but could never procure them, till since the Duties upon Glass-wares, which has drove some, and will unavoidable (if continued) drive the rest out of this Nation, to Foreign Parts, who are very willing to Incourage them, (nay Invite them) Witness <hi>Ireland,</hi> who having since the said Duty got some of them, and to shew their willingness to Incourage them, and the Glass-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, have laid so great a Duty on all Glass Imported as prohibits all Glass from hence, tho we used to send great quantities thither: They also Invite some other of the greatest Artists we have in <hi>England</hi> over, set up Houses there, giving the aforesaid Accompt, and that there is a very brisk Trade for Glass there; and this is evident by a Letter shewed to several Members of this Honourable House, bearing Date from <hi>Ireland</hi> the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> last; and likewise several Glass-works are Erecting in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in hopes our Loss will be their Gain.</p>
            <p>Then if this Manufacture be destroyed, consequently the Manufacturing our said several Commodities will be discouraged (nay lost) his Majesty's Customs lessened for want of Manufacturing the said Materials Imported, and the said Poor loose the Livelyhood they receiv'd from both; but with Humble Submission if we suffer these things, we mistake the main Point and Interest of the Nation.</p>
            <p>For undeniable the Happiness of this, or any other Nation, consist chiefly in Manufacturing its own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, to expend at home, and vend abroad; as also to have Commodities from abroad to Manufacture at home; for by this means we gain the Ballance of Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Example:</hi> We do by Importing 1000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Foreign Commodities make as much (and better) Glass, as formerly cost the Nation 10000 <hi>l.</hi> from <hi>Venice, &amp;c.</hi> so that by Manufacturing 1000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Foreign Commodities, we gain 9000 <hi>l.</hi> besides the Imploying many Thousands of poor, and the Subject served Cheaper than before.</p>
            <p>And that no Fund may be Cheated, or this Honourable House put to the trouble of making good such Fund, I answer that whole sale Projector, that on Wednesday last in print, proposed the Glass as a Fund for 40000 <hi>l. per An.</hi> there never was 40000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of all sorts of Glass spent in <hi>England</hi> in any one year.</p>
            <p>But I cannot tell but this Projector may take his Measures from some interested person in Collecting the said Duties, who daily attend at the door, (in particular one Mr. <hi>Allen</hi>) and whisper it about, though the Crown has received but little Duty as yet from Glass, yet more will be received in following Quarters; which is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, when there is above 40000 Dozen of Glass Bottles made before-hand in the Makers hands, besides what the Glass-sellers or Potters have by them. And they also whisper and insinuate, the Duty cannot Ruine the Manufacture, for while Glass is now sold Cheaper than before the Duty, and therefore the Maker gets by it, or he would not sell it so.</p>
            <p>Which is a pretty wheadle (to contrive their own Interest) and make Necessity an Argument to continue Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon others; when the Maker by endeavouring to raise his Glass to such a price, as he might pay the Kings Duty, hath occasioned the same to be left on his hands, till meer necessity obliged him to sell at any rate, as he doth to his loss 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> this is whispered for gain, the end of which will be the Ruine of the Glass Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture.</p>
